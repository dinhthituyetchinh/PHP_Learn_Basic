1,You Are Not Just Talented You Are Spiritually Gifted,And I am not that special for saying that. Most of us want to leave an imprint on the world that makes it better. Sure maybe our ambitions are vastly different. Some of us dream of influencing the WHOLE world while some of us see OUR world as the people we aim to influence. Nevertheless all of us want to make a good difference. And thats a good thing! God wants that for us too.,11/02/2024,image1.jpg
2,A Lesson in Reading the Commands of Scripture,The more you study Scripture the more you see how important context is for understanding the meaning of a passage. This is especially important when it comes to seeing how the commands of Scripture fit with the truths that ground them. Or to say it another way:,14/01/2024,image2.jpg
3,Living with Purpose,Why am I here? Its the biggest existential question we all must wrestle with. We all long to understand our purpose. And if we truly want to understand our purpose we must know it all starts with God. Its not about you; its not about me; its not about this person or that person. ,11/01/2024,image3.jpg
4,You Were Loved Into Existence,The beginning of the year is often a time of deep reflection. Our hope is that your thoughts are not only directed toward your resolutions but also about more profound existential questions. We will help you get there: our first two months of sermons are entirely directed toward the subject of purpose!,07/01/2024,image4.jpg
5,Bible Verses to Ground Your Day in Gratitude,Its the opening line of a book I have been reading to my son in this season of life. And it has me thinking: Do I wake up with a very thankful heart? Or is this another one of those times as a parent where the books we hope to influence our children do not seem to pierce our callous heart? Ill admit this is a bit melodramatic. ,19/11/2023,image5.jpg
6,Be Busy Not Hurried,Good! But busy. Tired but good! Its amazing how many of our answers are some sort of combination of good and busy as if those two go together like peanut butter and jelly. We wear busyness as a badge of honor. ,12/11/2023,image6.jpg
